Summarise:

> **Summary.** Global parameters taken from @schmitt2024.

> **Summary.** Taxonomy and dbhmax taken from LBA inventories, ah, and hmax inferred from TALLO[@jucker2022], leaf, wood and hydraulic traits from @schmitt2024, TRY [@kattge2019] and BIOMASS [@réjou-méchain2017], and missing traits imputed using `missForest` with phylogeny [@10.1111/2041-210X.14339].

> **Summary.** Soil parameters taken from @schmitt2024.

> > **Summary.** Historical climate forcing from ERA5-Land between 1980 and 2025 [@muñoz-sabater2021] was used as showing good correlation with local measurements.

> **Summary. F**uture climate forcing from CMIP6 GCM between 1980 and 2100 under low emission scenarii SSP1-2.6 and high emission scenarii SSP5-8.5 (ref) statistically downscaled on ERA5-Land historical data per month using cumulative distribution function transformation CDFt (ref).
