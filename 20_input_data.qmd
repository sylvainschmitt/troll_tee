# Input data {.unnumbered}

> **Summary**. Global parameters were taken from @schmitt2024. Taxonomy and maximum diameter were taken from LBA inventories. Allometric height parameters were inferred from TALLO [@jucker2022], and leaf, wood, and hydraulic traits were taken from @schmitt2024, TRY [@kattge2019], and BIOMASS [@réjou-méchain2017]. Missing traits were imputed using `missForest` with phylogeny [@gendre2024]. Soil parameters were also taken from @schmitt2024. Historical climate forcing from ERA5-Land between 1980 and 2025 was used as it showed a good correlation with local measurements. Future climate forcing was obtained from CMIP6 GCMs between 1980 and 2100 under low-emission scenarios SSP1-2.6 and high-emission scenarios SSP5-8.5 [@neill2016], and was statistically downscaled on ERA5-Land historical data on a monthly basis using a cumulative distribution function transformation (CDFt) [@vrac2015].
