# Data {.unnumbered}

We propose to take advantage of the extensive data collection from the Lartge Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA-ECO, <https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=11>) available at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC).

We differentiated data for three purposes according to three available sites near Santar√©m, Para, Brazil:

-   **Undisturbed** data from the undisturbed plots, mainly at the km-67 site, used for model inputs and undisturbed model simulations validation
-   **TEE** (Throughfall Exclusion Experiment) data from the TEE at the km 67 Seca Floresta site, used for model inputs and TEE model simulations validation. Note that control plots can be used as undisturbed data.
-   **Logged** data from the TEE at the km-83 site, that might be later used for model inputs and logging model simulations validation. Note that control plots can be used as undisturbed data. Note that this is just to be listed but not to be used in this project.

We further differentiated data depending on their usage following @schmitt2024 analyses:

-   **Species** [input]{.underline} data for species parametrization mainly based on functional traits measurements.
-   **Climate** [input]{.underline} data for simulation forcing mainly based on weather station and eddy flux towers.
-   **Soil** [input]{.underline} data for simulation forcing.
-   **Forest** [evaluation]{.underline} data for forest structure, composition, and dynamics evaluation mainly based on forest inventories (but can also include others such as lidar data).
-   **Fluxes** [evaluation]{.underline} data for forest carbon, water, and leaf fluxes based on eddy flux data, phenological data, litter data, and soil measurements.
-   **Microclimate** [evaluation]{.underline} data for finer microclimatic information not included in fluxes, mainly carbon, water and temperature vertical profiles. *Not sure if it will be included in the end or not.*

Note that some datasets include data covering several usage. Below are listed all data by purpose and usage and they are illustrated in following pages.
